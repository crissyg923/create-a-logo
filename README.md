![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)
## Description
This project uses node and object oriented programming  to create a logo generator that accepts user input and utilizes it to create a custom logo.  This appliction is very useful for business owners that need simple logos or for someone looking for branded placeholder images.  Executing this project solidified my understanding of creating class constructors and how useful they can be.  I also furthured my understanding of node and its many use cases.

## Installation
This project can be installed by cloning the [command-line-readme](https://github.com/crissyg923/command-line-readme) repository.

## Usage
You can run the application by typing node index.js in your terminal and answering the prompts.  Upon completing the prompts, an SVG file with your specified criteria will be generated and can be found in the output folder.

## Credits
I worked with a Rutgers Full Stack tutor and made use of code from class assignments to guide me in creating the code.

## How to Contribute
Someone can contribute by adding more options to the logo generator, such as the option to add symbols or other more intricate details.

## Tests
I ran tests on the shapes.js file to ensure that the class constructors were properly instantiating new triangle, circle, and square classes.  I also ran tests to make sure that errors were successfully being thrown.
